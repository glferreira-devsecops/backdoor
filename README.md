## 🚨 Overview

This project is a **satirical, interactive dossier** built for the "Não Importa" podcast. It leverages **Neo-Brutalism**, **Glitch Art**, and **System OS** aesthetics to create an immersive, gamified experience where everything—including the user's patience—is tested.

Designed to meet **Awwwards** standards for creative coding, interaction design, and technical performance.

🔗 **Live Demo**: [Deploy on Vercel](https://github.com/glferreira-devsecops/backdoor)

## 🎨 The "Chaos OS" Design System

The UI/UX approach defies traditional heuristics in favor of **narrative immersion**:

1. **Spatial Nihilism**: Elements like the *Nihilist Cookie Banner* offer false choices. The *Processometer* invades screen real estate to remind users of legal risks.
2. **Physics-Based Interaction**: Profile cards use spring physics (`stiffness: 300`, `damping: 20`) to feel heavy and tactile.
3. **Glitch Semiotics**: A persistent `CRTOverlay` and random `skew` animations simulate a hacked or failing terminal, reinforcing the "Leaked Dossier" narrative.
4. **Micro-Interactions**:
    - **Hover**: Color inversion + Glitch overlay.
    - **Cursor**: Custom `crosshair` to gamify navigation.
    - **Sound**: Visual cues mimic audio distortion.

## 🧩 Key Features

### 1. The Cancelometer 📉

A dynamic risk assessment engine that calculates the probability of each cast member being cancelled.
- **João Vicente**: 92% (High Risk - Podolatria).
- **Gregório**: 88% (High Risk - Sleep).

### 2. The Porchat Listener 🎙️

A background "wiretap" simulation. It triggers a toast notification accusing the user of making excuses, powered by `Math.random` chaos logic.

### 3. Infinite Excuse Scroll 📜

A marquee component that loops valid excuses for being late ("O Uber cancelou", "Tava chovendo", "O cachorro comeu o Wi-Fi").

### 4. Easter Eggs 🥚

- **Robots.txt**: Blocks "GoodVibesBot".
- **Console**: Insults developers who inspect element.
- **Konami Code**: (Just kidding, nobody has time for that).
